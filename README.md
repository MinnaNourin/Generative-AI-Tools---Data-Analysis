# 🧠 Generative AI Tools – Data Analysis

This project explores and visualizes data about various **Generative AI tools** using Python.  
The analysis focuses on understanding tool categories, modalities, and API availability through clear and interactive visualizations.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

Generative AI tools are rapidly transforming industries — from text and image generation to code assistance and multimodal capabilities.  
This analysis uses Python’s data visualization libraries to uncover insights such as:

- Which categories of AI tools are most common  
- How modalities (text, image, video, etc.) are distributed  
- The availability of APIs and open-source options

---

## 🧩 Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing using **Pandas**
- Category vs. Modality visualization using **Seaborn heatmaps**
- API availability and open-source status analysis
- Easy-to-read, notebook-based workflow for reproducibility
